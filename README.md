# sodalite

An implimentation of tweetnacl in pure rust. Originally generated by manually translating `tweetnacl.c` into rust. Tested by verifying outputs match those of tweetnacl.

[Documentation (general)](http://codyps.com/docs/sodalite/index.html)

Note: we should be exposing a consistent API across platforms, but we do generate seperate docs for each just in case.

[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sodalite)

## Todo

 - provide additional APIs:
  - rather than take bare mutable references, use wrapper types around the refs to capture the underlying type (ie: prevent mixing keys between primitives)
  - add a buffer and/or "set-only" abstraction to prevent unsafety wrt uninitialized values (also should allow some internal optimization).
  - sodiumoxide style API that returns values rather than taking mutable refs
 - Use namespacing to seperate different APIs and backend impls
 - Provide type aliases for existing fixed arrays
 - Split out `index_N` and `index_mut_N` functions into a seperate crate
 - start testing against sodiumoxide as well
 - Provide some of the API impovements from libsodium that are missing nacl (disjoint signatures, not requiring special extra space in buffers)
